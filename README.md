# flashcards

In a nutshell, a very basic implementation of the Anki learning system for kanji. 

Learn kanji by loading the kanjidamage website (full credits to the website owner) for each kanji and asking you if you knew the meaning. 

If you tell the program you knew the meaning of the displayed kanji, its flashcard will advance to the next box, else it will go back by one box. 

Boxes are repeatedly learned after set day intervals proportional to how often you have to be correct to reach each box. <br>
(So the learning intervals should increase for each kanji that you knew the meaning of the more often you were correct.) 

Learning all boxes in one go is also built in.
